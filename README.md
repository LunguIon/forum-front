## 💡<span id="info">Additonal information</span>
**Code scaffolding** <br>
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

**Running unit tests** <br>
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

**Running end-to-end tests** <br>
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
